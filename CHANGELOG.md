# 6.0.3
- Fixeds #96. Change the generator so if the symbol contains a $ we prefix the string with 'r'.
- spelling.

# 6.0.2-beta.2
- Fixes issue with trailing Currency isoCodes throwing a range exception as reported in #95.

# 6.0.2-beta.1
- BREAKING: Fixes #95. This problem was a regression caused as part of the 6.x release.
  The issue was that group separators after the first (right most) group where
  being treated incorrectly.  
  We now treat #,### == ###,###
  and ##,### == ##,###

We also fixed a long standing issue with common currences.
All CommonCurrencies has been defined without group separators. 
This has now been changed so that all common currencies are
defined with the appropriate group separators.

This means that the pattern for USD (and most other currencies) changes 
from S0.00 to S#,##0.00.
All common currencies are now defined with group separators as appropriate
for that currency.

The implication is that formatting with the old behavour would give $9000 whilst
the new behavour would give $9,000.
If you want to mimic the old behaviour you can simply set the pattern to the original 'S0.00'.

We have also changed how we are maintaing common currencies. 
We are are now generating common currencies from a yaml file.
To regenerate common currences run:
dart tool/generate_common_currencies.dart


# 6.0.1
- Added method isNonZero as a convenience.

# 6.0.0
 - Breaking All occurances of the Precentage named arg 'scale' have been changed to decimalDigits.
 - change all occurance of scale to decimalDigits. Upgraded to Fixed 6.0
 
# 6.0.0-beta.4
- Breaking: Money operator * now returns the same decimalDigits as the original
   Money instance. Previously we use the Currencies decimal Digits.
- upgraded to fixed 5.3.4
- Fixed broken examples in the readme and the main doco site.
- Fixed a bug in operator * which truncated the scale of doubles. We now default to 16 digits. 
- Added a new method multiplyByNum to allow the user to expliclity control the scale.
- created tests for all examples.
- Added missing hkd from list of common currencies. Thanks to @hwh97 for raising the issue.

# 6.0.0-beta.3
BREAKING: change fromCode and toCode to fromIsoCode and toIsoCode in the ExchangeRate.fromMinorUnits and ExchangeRate.fromNum methods to bring it in line with other methods.
Change how ExchangeRates are stored to json to bring it in line with how we store money as json.

```dart 
/// old format
 Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
        'integerPart': 0,
        'decimalPart': 68
        'decimals': 2,
        'fromIsoCode': 'AUD'
        'toIsoCode': 'USD'
        'toDecimalDigits': 3,
      };

/// new format
        'minorUnits': '75312',
        'decimals': 5,
        'fromIsoCode': 'AUD',
        'toIsoCode': 'USD',
        'toDecimals': 3,
```
Note that 'minorUnits' is a string to avoid overflow issues when javascript parses the json and the integer is larger than a javascript num.

# 6.0.0-beta.2
 BREAKING: the 'precision' argument to Currencies.copyWith has been renamed from
 precision to decimalDigits
 
# 6.0.0-beta.1
- Add: support for large numbers. Thanks to @nesquikm's significant contribution we now
support numbers upto 100 digits (in both the integer and decimal components) and the library probably works for larger numbers as well - we use BigInt under the hood which is only limited by memory.

- New formatting engine. We have done a complete rewrite of the engine that formats money amounts which has alowed us to fix a number of 
  long time outstanding issue. In particular we now support the india clustering of thousands '##,###.##' and in general the engine should prove to be much more flexible.
- Add: we now support the '+' character in a pattern. When present we will either print '+' or '-' based on the sign of the number.
    This compares with the '-' pattern which will print a '-' (if the amount is -ve) but never a '+' character.
- Breaking: a pattern for the integer component like '0#' is now illegal and will throw. If used the '0' character can only come after any '#' character e.g. '#0' is allowed.
- Breaking: a pattern for the decimal component like 'xxxx.#0' is now illegal and will throw. If used the '0' character must come before any '#' character e.g. 'xxx.0#' is allowed.
- Breaking: change the json format as the current format was likely to break any javascript code that tried to parse it when it contained a large number.
  Given the breaking change we also took the opportunity to improve the format. We now have 'minorUnits', 'decimals' and 'isoCode' as the three fields.

  For example to store the value USD $10.25
  
  The old format contained four fields:
```dart
        'integerPart': 10
        'decimalPart': 25
        'decimals': 2
        'isoCode': 'USD"
```

The new format only has 3 fields and the minor units are a string to avoid javascript consumers throwing on big values:
```dart
     final expectedJson = <String, dynamic>{
    'minorUnits': '1025',
    'decimals': 2,
    'isoCode': 'USD',
    };
```
- Additional IllegalPatternException are now thrown when formatting a number if the pattern is invalid.

# 5.4.6
- modified Percentage.tryParse to return null if the amount can't be parsed. Previoulsy we returned zero which isn't in keeping with the expected signature a tryParse method.

# 5.4.5
- changed percentage.copyWith so it returns a Percentage not a Fixed.

# 5.4.4
- Fixed a bug in the multipledByPercent, it was failing to divide by 100 after we changed the way percentages are represented.

# 5.4.3
- added additional tests.
- fixed arg names to divide methods.
- added methods
  multipliedByPercentage
  percentageOf

- added helper class Percentage.
as a whole number rather than a decimal e.g. 10% is stored as 10 not 0.1


# 5.4.0
- added json serialisation to Money, Currency and ExchangeRate
 A big thanks to https://github.com/marcelomendoncasoares for this
 excellent contribution.

# 5.3.0
- Merge pull request #88 from bryanoltman/bo/fix-typo

- Merge pull request #86 from karelklic/operator==  which now takes an Object? for other so that we work with
the likes of the freezed package.


# 5.1.0
- Added additional conversion operations. Upgraded to Fixed 5.0.
- released 5.0.1

# 5.0.0
The driver for this release and the breaking changes comes from:
https://github.com/onepub-dev/money.dart/issues/79

The aim is to allow users to fully customise the group and decimal separators.
We have also renamed 'scale' to 'decimalDigits' as this term is likely to be
more familiar to users.

## breaking changes
- The 'invertSeparator' argument to the Currency class has been broken out 
into two separate arguments 'groupSeparator' and 'decimalSeparator'. 
If you are using 'invertSeparator: true' then you need to replace this with
```dart
  groupSeparator: '.',
  decimalSeparator: ',',
```
- patterns used for parsing and formatting must always use ',' for group separators
and '.' for decimal separators regardless of what has been used for the
groupSeparator and decimalSeparator.
This allows a single pattern to be used across currencies rather than having
to create a unique pattern for each currency when looking to use custom formats.

This means that if you have been using 'invertSeparator: true' then you will 
need to modifiy any custom patterns from '#.###,##' to '#,###.##'.
Note the change in the separators!


- For methods that take a 'code' it has been renamed 'isoCode' to make the
correct use of the code more apparent.

- renamed PatterDecoder.isCode to isIsoCode
- renamed CurrencyCode to CurrencyIsoCode
- renamed all occurances of 'scale' to 'decimalDigits' as many people
  are not familiar with the concept of scale.
- changed toScale on ExchangeRate members to be 'toDecimalDigits'.

## non-breaking changes
- Fixed doco for Currencies class as it is a singleton and it's needs methods need to be called  via Currencies()...

## Full set of currency codes
Thanks to the work of [fueripe-desu](https://github.com/fueripe-desu) we now have a full set of currency codes
and associated formatting built into common-currencies.
An heroic piece of work - so much thanks to fueripe-desu from myself and the wider Dart
community.


# 5.0.0-alpha.2
- updated the list of supported platforms.

# 5.0.0-alpha.1

## non-breaking changes
- Fixed doco for Currencies class as it is a singleton and it's needs methods need to be called  via Currencies()...

# 4.1.0
- upgraded to intl 0.19

# 4.0.0
- updated min sdk to 3.x

# 3.4.0
- upgraded to: fixed 2.4.0, intl 0.18, meta 1.9.0

# 3.3.0
- Upgraded to fixed 2.3.0 and Decimal 2.3.0 to fixed a compilation problem caused by a breaking change in decimal. upgraded to lint_hard. Increased the minimum sdk to 2.14 as reflect decimals minimum sdk.

# 3.2.0
- updated to the latest version of decimal, fixed and meta.
- BREAKING: The exchange rate formatter was incorrectly displaying the rate as a currency when its just a scalar value. The currency symbol prefix has now been removed. The exchange rate format was also performing rounding  when the scale was larger than the no. of decimals the format included. This was not the intended behaviour. It now truncates the no. of decimals to reflect the format pattern. If you want rounding then you should scale the no. before formatting it.

# 3.1.4
- Fixed: #69 - tryParse throws when Money empty - thanks to LewisHolliday
- add failing tryParse tests
- add tests for parse with invalid input
- Money.parse now correctly throws MoneyParseException when an invalid amount is passed.

# 3.1.3
- exported money_data.dart in the barrel file.
- corrected spelling for  Money.fromBigIntWitCurrency and ExchangeRate.fromFixedWitCurrency
- updated links from noojee.dev to onepub.dev

# 3.1.2
Corrected the home page link

# 3.1.0
- Merge pull request #59 from niklasbartsch/Upraded-to-the-latest-version-of-fixed
- Fixes: error when using Money2 in a Flutter Web environment due to the reduced size of an int (53bits vs 64 bits).

# 3.0.0-beta2
- added notes on v2-v3 conversion.
- Changed ExchangePlatform to work with ExchangeRate changes.
- Added ctors to ExchangeRate for the supported data types. 
- Added a method to apply an inverse rate.  Added the from Currency so it could be used in the ExchangePlatform and is fully self desribing.
- Fixed the # char for decimal patterns as it was acting like the 0 char.
- Made the Code and Symbol patterns optional.
- renamed Money.from to Money.fromNum. 
- Added Money.fromIntWithCurrency. 
- Added Money.fromDecimal 
- Added operators for Money and Fixed operations.
- Change all exceptions to be derived from a common MoneyException.
- Updated bitcoins pattern to make it consistent with other currencies.
- Added the exchange_platform to the set of exported classes.
- Added decimalPart to moneyData. 
- Added sign to Money.

# 2.3.0
- In response to issue #53 we have modified how excess minorUnits (decimals) are parsed.  Even if the parse pattern doesn't contain decimal places we will still parse decimal places in the Monetary Value. This ensures that we always retain the original parsed values precisions. However the api is currently quiet on how precision is treated when parsing decimals. We have now documented the api to state that we will parse upto the Currencies defined precisions.
- - This means:
   if you pass a monetary value with decimal digits in excess of the Currencies precision they will be ignored.
   If you pass a monetary value with decimal digits in excess of the passed pattern then they will be parsed upto the precision of the Currency.
- Fixed a bug where parsing a no. of the form '.99' (i.e. no leading major digit) would thrown an exception.

# 2.2.2
- Fix overflow issue when using high precision currencies - thanks to Bob Jackman for the contribution.


# 3.0.0-beta.6
- Added additional tests for INR.
- INR had invertseparator as true which isn't correct for INR. The pattern was also wrong.

# 3.0.0-beta.5

This also sides steps bug #50.

# 3.0.0-beta.4
- reverted meta to 1.3 as flutter_test isn't compatible with meta 1.7 Fixes: #47

# 3.0.0-beta.3
- upgraded to latest meta.
- moved to lints package.
- added [] and []= operators to access Currencies.
- cleaned up package imports.

# 3.0.0-beta.2
Revised the Money constructors to take a currency 'code' rather than a currency.

```
Money.from(100, CommonCurrency.usd);

becomes

Money.from(100, 'USD');

Old methods are still available as:

Money.fromWithCurrency(100, CommonCurrency.usd);

```

To support this CommonCurrencies are now automatically registered.

# 3.0.0-beta.1
Breaking changes
- re-implemented each of the == operator to use 'covariant' rather than taking a dynamic as this moves the type check to a compile time error rather than a runtime error. You can nolonger pass a dynamic to the == operator.
- Changed the Currencies class to a singleton as per #38. You will need to change calls such as:
```
Currencies.register() -> Currences().register();
Currencies.registerAll() -> Currences().registerAll();
Currencies.parse() -> Currences().parse();
```
- restructured the unit test directory so it confirms to the recommended structure.
